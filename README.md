## Commit message type

The commit message type must follow the `conventional commit` convention based on [angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)

**N.B**: the version of package is not automatically bumped; these settings should be used in conjunction with a `git-flow` tool, which will handle release management
